# relaytouille
a very spaghetti home automation implemented on a random night out of spite <br>
the app.js file controls the arduino nano which in turn controls the relays which in turn control the appliances in my home <br>
the whole thing is hosted on an old rusty android (cuz im too lazy to buy/configure an RPI). The server can be accessed from anywhere in the world. (not sharing the URL cuz then ill be bullied)
